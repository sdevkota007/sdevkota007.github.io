abstract: Modern-day display systems demand high-quality rendering. However, rendering
  at higher resolution requires a large number of data samples and is computationally
  expensive. Recent advances in deep learning-based image and video super-resolution
  techniques motivate us to investigate such networks for high fidelity upscaling
  of frames rendered at a lower resolution to a higher resolution. While our work
  focuses on super-resolution of medical volume visualization performed with direct
  volume rendering, it is also applicable for volume visualization with other rendering
  techniques. We propose a learning-based technique where our proposed system uses
  color information along with other supplementary features gathered from our volume
  renderer to learn efficient upscaling of a low resolution rendering to a higher
  resolution space. Furthermore, to improve temporal stability, we also implement
  the temporal reprojection technique for accumulating history samples in volumetric
  rendering. Our method allows high-quality reconstruction of images from highly aliased
  input.
