 abstract = {Modern-day display systems demand high-quality rendering. However, rendering at higher resolution requires a large number of data samples and is computationally expensive. Recent advances in deep learning-based image and video super-resolution techniques motivate us to investigate such networks for high fidelity upscaling of frames rendered at a lower resolution to a higher resolution. While our work focuses on super-resolution of medical volume visualization performed with direct volume rendering, it is also applicable for volume visualization with other rendering techniques. We propose a learning-based technique where our proposed system uses color information along with other supplementary features gathered from our volume renderer to learn efficient upscaling of a low resolution rendering to a higher resolution space. Furthermore, to improve temporal stability, we also implement the temporal reprojection technique for accumulating history samples in volumetric rendering. Our method allows high-quality reconstruction of images from highly aliased input.},
