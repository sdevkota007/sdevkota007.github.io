abstract: In this paper, we propose an efficient approach for the compression and
  representation of volumetric data utilizing coordinate-based networks and multi-resolution
  hash encoding. Efficient compression of volumetric data is crucial for various applications,
  such as medical imaging and scientific simulations. Our approach enables effective
  compression by learning a mapping between spatial coordinates and intensity values.
  We compare different encoding schemes and demonstrate the superiority of multiresolution
  hash encoding in terms of compression quality and training efficiency. Furthermore,
  we leverage optimization-based meta-learning, specifically using the Reptile algorithm,
  to learn weight initialization for neural representations tailored to volumetric
  data, enabling faster convergence during optimization. Additionally, we compare
  our approach with state-of-the-art methods to showcase improved image quality and
  compression ratios. These findings highlight the potential of coordinate-based networks
  and multi-resolution hash encoding for an efficient and accurate representation
  of volumetric data, paving the way for advancements in large-scale data visualization
  and other applications.
