abstract: 'The benefits of medical imaging are enormous. Medical images provide considerable
  amounts of anatomical information and this facilitates medical practitioners in
  performing effective disease diagnosis and deciding upon the best course of medical
  treatment. A transition from traditional monochromatic medical images like CT scans,
  X-Rays, or MRI images to a colored 3D representation of the anatomical structure
  could further aid medical professionals in extracting valuable medical information.
  The proposed framework in our research starts with performing color transfer by
  finding deep semantic correspondence between two medical images: a colored reference
  image, and a monochromatic CT scan or an MRI image. We extend this idea of reference
  based colorization technique to perform colored volume rendering from a stack of
  grayscale medical images. Furthermore, we also propose to use an effective reference
  image recommendation system to aid for selection of good reference images. With
  our approach, we successfully perform colored medical volume visualization and essentially
  eliminate the painstaking process of user interaction with a transfer function to
  obtain color parameters for volume rendering.'
