   abstract = {In this paper, we propose an efficient approach for the compression and representation of volumetric data utilizing coordinate-based networks and multi-resolution hash encoding. Efficient compression of volumetric data is crucial for various applications, such as medical imaging and scientific simulations. Our approach enables effective compression by learning a mapping between spatial coordinates and intensity values. We compare different encoding schemes and demonstrate the superiority of multiresolution hash encoding in terms of compression quality and training efficiency. Furthermore, we leverage optimization-based meta-learning, specifically using the Reptile algorithm, to learn weight initialization for neural representations tailored to volumetric data, enabling faster convergence during optimization. Additionally, we compare our approach with state-of-the-art methods to showcase improved image quality and compression ratios. These findings highlight the potential of coordinate-based networks and multi-resolution hash encoding for an efficient and accurate representation of volumetric data, paving the way for advancements in large-scale data visualization and other applications.},

   abstract = {Modern-day display systems demand high-quality rendering. However, rendering at higher resolution requires a large number of data samples and is computationally expensive. Recent advances in deep learning-based image and video super-resolution techniques motivate us to investigate such networks for high fidelity upscaling of frames rendered at a lower resolution to a higher resolution. While our work focuses on super-resolution of medical volume visualization performed with direct volume rendering, it is also applicable for volume visualization with other rendering techniques. We propose a learning-based technique where our proposed system uses color information along with other supplementary features gathered from our volume renderer to learn efficient upscaling of a low resolution rendering to a higher resolution space. Furthermore, to improve temporal stability, we also implement the temporal reprojection technique for accumulating history samples in volumetric rendering. Our method allows high-quality reconstruction of images from highly aliased input.},

   abstract = {The benefits of medical imaging are enormous. Medical images provide considerable amounts of anatomical information and this facilitates medical practitioners in performing effective disease diagnosis and deciding upon the best course of medical treatment. A transition from traditional monochromatic medical images like CT scans, X-Rays, or MRI images to a colored 3D representation of the anatomical structure could further aid medical professionals in extracting valuable medical information. The proposed framework in our research starts with performing color transfer by finding deep semantic correspondence between two medical images: a colored reference image, and a monochromatic CT scan or an MRI image. We extend this idea of reference based colorization technique to perform colored volume rendering from a stack of grayscale medical images. Furthermore, we also propose to use an effective reference image recommendation system to aid for selection of good reference images. With our approach, we successfully perform colored medical volume visualization and essentially eliminate the painstaking process of user interaction with a transfer function to obtain color parameters for volume rendering.},
